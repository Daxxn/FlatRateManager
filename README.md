# Flat Rate Job Tracker

Simplified version of the `Repair Order Tracker` [Client](https://github.com/Daxxn/RepairOrderTrackerClient) & [Server](https://github.com/Daxxn/RepairOrderTrackerServer). The full project is still on the books but it needs some major changes and I need to get this up and running. I let scope creep get its teeth into it. This is the lean mean version.
